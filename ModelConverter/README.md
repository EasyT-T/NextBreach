# ModelConverter

A simple tool used NextBreach for example.
(Actually, it's because my RMesh files don't work on Reborn v1.3)

## Feature

- Auto convert "model" entity to "mesh" entity.
- Auto replace "door01.b3d" to "door01.x".

## Usage
Drag all the RMesh files you want to convert to the program, then it will generate a %original_name%_opt.rmesh file, please rename it to the name you want.
